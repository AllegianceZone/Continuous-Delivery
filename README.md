STEP 3 - post your az trac username (http://allegiancezone.com/trac) and windows computer name of slave to http://allegiancezone.com/forum

STEP 4 - look for a reply
	1. wait untill `build admin` permissions are added to your az trac account and you are given the code signing certificate, private key and password files

STEP 5 - install cert and password files
	1. from the directory you cloned in STEP 2 execute the following:
	     certutil -user -addstore Root AZCA.cer
	     makecert -pe -n "CN=Allegiance Zone Development" -a sha256 -cy end -ss Mine -sky signature -ic AZCA.cer -iv AZCA.pvk -sv MySPC.pvk MySPC.cer
	2. Copy the admin.txt and pass.txt files from STEP 4 to the root of the C:\ drive
	
STEP 6 - make a C:\AllegBeta\Artwork with minimum server files (~40MB simply copy Artwork_minimal and the cvh, txt and igcs from Artwork)
	1. run server.reg

STEP 7 - copy slaveconf.sample.ini to slaveconf.ini and configure accordingly

STEP 8 - execute run_bitten_slave.bat
	1. agree to the sysinternal licenses that popup when pskill/etc utilities run for the first time


Your machine will now automaticaly publish a build and run/update a server with bots when https://github.com/AllegianceZone/Allegiance gets pushed
